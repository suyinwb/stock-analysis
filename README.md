# Stock Analysis

## Background
The initial purpose of our analysis is to help Steve's parents analyse:
* how actively DQ was traded in 2018 as they believe that if a stock is traded often, then the price will accurately reflect the value of the stock. We sum up all of the daily volume for DQ to get the yearly volume and a rough idea of how often it gets traded. We calculate the yearly return for DQ. The yearly return is the percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. In other words, if you invested in DQ at the beginning of the year and never sold, the yearly return is how much your investment grew or shrunk by the end of the year.
From this, we found out that Daqo dropped over 63% in 2018.
* Due to the above, we replicated our script to analyse all the stocks on the dataset to give Steve's parents a full view of all the stocks' performance.
* In order to make the spreadsheet more user-friendly, we've included buttons to make it easier for Steve to use.
* We've also added flexiblity for Steve to input the year he is interested to analyse with aninput field.
* We've also added a functionality to calculate how long it takes to execute the output and elapsed time in a message box.

From this work, Steve is able to use the tool with ease and churn his dataset for analysis.

## Overview of Project

Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

From our previous partnership, she now wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
The same dataset from her first analysis which is the dataset from 2009 to 2017, will be used for this second analysis.

### Purpose
Louise will like to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
